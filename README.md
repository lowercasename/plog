# Plog - a personal logger

Plog is a minimalist command line utility which I wrote to help myself record two things I would like to keep better track of: my mood and, because I have eczema, the health of my skin.

Plog is written in Python and is dedicated to everyone who has a bad brain or bad skin. You got this. <3
